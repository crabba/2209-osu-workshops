Introduction
============

Today we will be deploying and running a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster by running a genomics analysis example from the `Amazon Genomics CLI <https://aws.amazon.com/genomics-cli/>`_, in individual  temporary AWS accounts provided by AWS through Event Engine.

We will be working at the command line, inside the AWS Cloud9 environment.  No previous knowledge of genomics, HPC, the AWS Console, or the command line is necessary, as all commands are provided.  However if you are familiar with any of these concepts, you are free to explore them in the provided AWS account.
